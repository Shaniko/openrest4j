The OpenRest API
================

OpenRest is a modern system for online food ordering, enabling hungry customers to browse restaurant menus and submit delivery or take-out orders.

OpenRest offers a comprehensive public API for 3rd-party apps, POS systems and payment processors.
We have an open attitude for working with new partners, ping us for details: info@openrest.com

The API is exposed as a standard web service that communicates JSON over HTTPS.
For convenience, we offer official libraries for Java (here), [.NET](https://github.com/openrest/openrest4net) and [JavaScript](https://github.com/openrest/openrest4js).
The Java library acts as the reference implementation and self-describes the API.

Standard use-cases: [3rd-party clients](https://github.com/openrest/openrest4j/wiki/Client-Integration), [POS systems](https://github.com/openrest/openrest4j/wiki/POS-Integration).
