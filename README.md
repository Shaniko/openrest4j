The OpenRest API
================

[OpenRest](https://www.openrest.com/) is a modern system for online food ordering, enabling hungry customers to browse restaurant menus and submit delivery or take-out orders.

OpenRest offers a comprehensive public API, exposed as a standard web service that communicates JSON over HTTPS.
Official libraries exist for Java (here), [.NET](https://github.com/openrest/openrest4net) and [JavaScript](https://github.com/openrest/openrest4js).

The Java library acts as the reference implementation and implicitly defines the API.

Standard use-cases: [3rd-party clients](https://github.com/openrest/openrest4j/wiki/Client-Integration), [POS systems](https://github.com/openrest/openrest4j/wiki/POS-Integration).

We have an open attitude for working with new partners, ping us for details: info@openrest.com
